# xMatters-Labs
Welcome to xMatters Labs, the official/unofficial Research and Development wing of xMatters, inc., and home to the most cutting edge integrations on offer. 

This is a repository of useful in-progress integrations, interesting code samples, and other experiments, and as such we can provide only limited support. If you run into any problems, open an issue here on Github and we'll see what we can do. 

If you have a script, a snippet, or even a fully-functional, two-way, closed-loop, rock-steady integration to add, submit a Pull Request and we'll review it. (At some point in the hopefully very near future, we'll add a template to follow for different types of submissions. For now, you can use the format of the existing integrations as a basis for any contributions you'd like to make.)

For a full list of our current integrations, head over to [xmatters.com/integrations](https://www.xmatters.com/integrations).
