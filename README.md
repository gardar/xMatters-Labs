# xMatters-Labs
Welcome to xMatters Labs, the official/unofficial Research and Development wing of xMatters, inc., and home to the most cutting edge integrations on offer. 

This is a curated list (based on the awesome framework of [awesome-cisco](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/awesome-ciscospark) and [awesome-go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go)) of useful in-progress integrations, interesting code samples, and other experiments, and as such we can provide only limited support. If you run into any problems, open an issue here on Github and we'll see what we can do. 

If you have a script, a snippet, or even a fully-functional, two-way, closed-loop, rock-steady integration to add head over to the [xM Labs Template](https://github.com/xmatters/xm-labs-template) repo for instructions on getting started. 

For a full list of our current integrations, head over to [xmatters.com/integrations](https://www.xmatters.com/integrations).
