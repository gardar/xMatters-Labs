# xMatters-Labs
This is a repository of useful integrations and experiments and as such should be considered Research and Development and as such we can only provide limited support. If you run into issues, open an issue here on github and we'll see what we can do. 

If you have a script, snippet or full integration to add, submit a Pull Request and we'll review it. At some point we'll add a template to follow. For now, try to match the format of the existing integrations. 

For a full list of our fully baked integrations, head over to [xmatters.com/integrations](https://www.xmatters.com/integrations).
